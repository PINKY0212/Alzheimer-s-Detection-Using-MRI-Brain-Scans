Alzheimer’s is caused because of dementia. Dementia is
not a single disease but rather covers a wide range of specific
conditions includinglAlzheimer’s disease. Theselalterations cause a
deterioration in thinking abilities,lalso known as cognitive
capacities, that is severe enough to impair day-to-day activities.
There are 3 stages of Alzheimer’s Disease Mild Cognitive
impairment (MCI), Moderate Alzheimer's Disease and Severe
Alzheimer's Disease. The symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease are
many, but the common and important signs are Memory loss,
challenges solving problems, difficulty completing familiar tasks,
lose track of time. There is no treatment that can slow or stop the
progression of Alzheimer's disease. There are types of drugs that
attempt to treat the cognitive symptoms and slow down the
progression.



Recent research has used multivariate data analysis to classify
dementia stages like MCI and AD, as well as machine
learning to predict dementia stage. The basic purpose of
clinical diagnosis is to automatically classify or anticipate
imaging phenotypes (features or patterns) based on the
disease stage. For this work, the classification of Alzheimer’s
disease using machine learning models on Kaggle dataset the
current performance of our models using NASNetMobile is
done the for better accuracy of the model we used Support
Vector Machine with which the accuracy rate of 48% and Random Forest Classifier which gave accuracy rate 82%, due to
small data. Due to the lack of neuropathological correlates
with MRI phenotypes, which is the gold standard for the
diagnostic decision support system, there are a few
methodological constraints in the present research for their
application in clinical diagnosis based on ML. Predicting
disease progression or transition from one stage to another,
on the other hand, necessitates longitudinal data analysis. The
proposed method's key advantage in the clinical situation is
that it uses a model with high accuracy and specificity in

diagnosing illness stage rather than burdensome higher-
dimensional image processing methods. The diseasecharacteristics in the staging of Alzheimer's disease, such as
mild, moderate, and severe, might vary from case to case to
represent the neuropathological alterations that are linked to
clinical symptoms.
